# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-with-TensorFlow
Using TensorFlow to build a neural network that will recognize images of handwritten digits. This repo is only the initial part of a project to implement MNIST digit classification from scratch, without using TensorFlow, meaning it serves as a introduction to how it is donde by USING Tensorflow, the project with the implementation from scratch can be found [here](https://github.com/Electromayonaise/MNIST-digit-classification)
